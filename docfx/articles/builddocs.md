# Building the Documentation with DocFX
* In Debug configuration the docfx project is not included in the solution build and needs to be built explicitly.
  * If built in Debug configuration, a preview will open at the end of the build.
* In Release configuration, building the solution will build the docfx project without triggering a preview.
