# Building the Documentation with DocFX
* Build the Visual Studio 2017 Solution
* Switch Solution Explorer to "Folder View"
* Right-click on the "docfx_project" folder, you should see three menu entries:
  1. Build Documentation
  1. Rebuild Documentation
  1. Run Documentation Web Site
* The names are self-explanatory. Notes:
  * One must build the site before running it.
  * The docfx_project menu items are defined in the tasks.vs.json file in the root of the solution.
  * Build progress is shown in the Output window.
